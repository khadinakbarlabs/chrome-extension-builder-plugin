description: Lead an interactive Manifest V3 Chrome extension workflow from research and architecture through UX, frontend, optional cloud design, security, testing, release preparation, and maintenance. Use for new browser tools, SaaS companions, reviews, upgrades, and repairs; optional local execution depends on the host.

# Chrome Extension Builder

Before any workflow, read the native [host guide](references/host-guide.md) and [policy boundaries](references/policy-boundaries.md). Host instructions and safeguards take priority. Use only task-scoped, sanitized inputs and synthetic fixtures. This is a skills-only plugin with no MCP, account service, credential intake, or automatic background services.

## Start interactively

Infer the user's job and existing choices from the conversation or explicitly supplied sanitized source. Ask at most three material questions: purpose/audience; local, cloud, or hybrid product; supported sites/surfaces/data. Do not assume arbitrary filesystem, browser, or shell access. In chat alone, produce a useful contract, architecture, UI/state specification, code artifacts, and acceptance plan as normal Markdown. Persistence and local tools are optional, never required for this core workflow.

Capture purpose, trigger, browser contexts, exact data/hosts, permission rationale, offline/account states, compatibility, budget assumptions, acceptance journeys, and requested deliverable. Preserve accepted decisions and intent as the user steers. A build request authorizes relevant reversible work within host permissions; no magic BUILD phrase. Material irreversible or external actions need actual user intent and host approval gates.

## Select the team

Read [team.json](references/team.json) and the selected `references/role-<id>.md` prompt. Its report paths and rubric govern assignments. Load only the relevant skills below. In a capable authorized host, delegate disjoint file ownership and explicit inputs/outputs; otherwise execute distinct sequential passes and disclose their independence limit. OpenAI specialist role contracts remain in the skill references; use supported host delegation or distinct sequential passes. Never invent agent runs.

Contract → relevant research → architecture/UX → interfaces/tests → frontend plus justified backend/integrations → assembled QA/security/performance → release. Start security at design; review final artifacts. Skip irrelevant stages with reasons. For each pass report outcome, assumptions, observed evidence, unresolved gate, and next dependency. Read [workflow contract](references/workflow-contract.md), [platform guide](references/platform-architecture.md), and [official ledger](references/official-links.md) only as needed.

## Optional local execution

Check explicit environment/tool availability first. The manual launcher is `scripts/extension_builder.mjs`, resolved from this skill directory, requiring Node 18+ and Python 3.10+ for Python tools. Read its help. Local scaffolding produces a working notes starter; metadata flags do not implement arbitrary products. For example:

```sh
node scripts/extension_builder.mjs scaffold --name "Quick Notes" --purpose "Keep notes on this device" --output ./quick-notes --popup --service-worker
node scripts/extension_builder.mjs check ./quick-notes --json
node scripts/extension_builder.mjs package ./quick-notes --output ./quick-notes.zip
```

Use framework build output containing manifest.json for checking/packaging. Implement the actual contract, packaged code, validated messages, worker recovery, scoped grants, accessible states, and testable errors. Cloud auth design is allowed for the separately generated product; credentials remain outside plugin inputs/artifacts. Billing examples use synthetic/test-mode design, not plugin subscription sales or checkout.

For optional Studio planning, use [chrome-extension-builder-studio](../chrome-extension-builder-studio/SKILL.md). Start no server automatically. It is a manually started local read-only planner, not native MCP UI or a build/delegation engine. Chat is the fallback when local access is unavailable.

## Verify and deliver

New features/bugs need meaningful behavior tests or a failing reproduction. Inspect generated output, then test the actual extension when supported. A webpage preview or static checker cannot prove Chrome API behavior. Document browser/version and exact artifact; mark unrun cases honestly. Never process real credentials or restricted records to test an account flow.

Deliver useful code/specification or authorized local source/package, run/load instructions, findings, and acceptance evidence. Separate source checks, real browser QA, backend deployment, store submission, and acceptance. Prepare concrete artifacts before requesting missing authority. Honor host gates and decline unsafe requests; do not bypass access controls or publish/bill from inferred intent. Directory eligibility, account verification, scan clearance, and host semantic evaluations remain pending until observed.
