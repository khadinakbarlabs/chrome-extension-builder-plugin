# Chrome Extension Builder: Studio

Before starting, read [policy boundaries](../chrome-extension-builder/references/policy-boundaries.md). Accept only a sanitized brief and explicit choices, never secrets/restricted records.

In chat, guide purpose → audience → local/cloud/hybrid → surfaces → sites/data/permissions → acceptance. Present editable choices and a reviewable normal Markdown plan. Use [chrome-extension-builder](../chrome-extension-builder/SKILL.md) for substantive work. A useful planning result requires no local server or persistent settings.

If the user specifically requests local Studio, first verify shell/Node/Python and bundled assets are available in their explicit environment. Resolve `../chrome-extension-builder/scripts/extension_builder.mjs` from this skill directory, read its help, and manually run its studio command only in that authorized environment. No automatic service startup, external exposure, MCP UI, or cloud connection. If unsupported, continue the chat planning flow and name the limitation.

Explain optional browser-memory/export controls before entering a plan. Studio checkboxes/scores are declarations, not executed tests or independent agents. Exit with a usable brief, chosen tradeoffs, next workflow, and actual startup status when attempted.
